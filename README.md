| Topic | Explanation | Notebook |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| Part 1 - Introduction to Modern NLP | Introduce the main topics needed to get a bit of understanding of the recent work in NLP. We will start with basic concepts and slowly move into discussing the more recent ideas. | - |
| Part 2 - Training and fine-tuning NLP Models | In this segment we are going to learn how to fine-tune a pretrained language model (DistilRoBERTa) for approaching a downstream task. We will take a look at two popular NLP tasks called sentiment classification and emotion classification. | - |
| Part 3 - Towards building real-world NLP powered applications | In the final segment we are going to look at a simple example of how to leverage pretrained LMs to build a text similarity search application. We will leverage Elasticsearch as a search engine and allow for fast search on sentence representations. | - |
